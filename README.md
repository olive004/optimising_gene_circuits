# Optimising genetic circuits with JAX

In this repository, an example use-case is demonstrated for leveraging JAX in synthetic biology modelling. Inspired by GeneNet.

Supporting code for ["Computational Synthetic Biology Enabled through JAX: A Showcase" (Gallup et al. 2024)](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acssynbio.4c00307).

To run the notebook, you will need to install the requirements in the `requirements.txt` file.
